## A Note on Jargon

Because Godot uses `direction` to refer to a node 2D's transform, and/or it may cause name clashes,
the game logic will sometimes refer to "direction", but that is only with respect to, outside of the
context of a projectile's actual current direction, the direction ("rotation") of a tank's turret.
